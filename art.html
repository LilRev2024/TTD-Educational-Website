   <p>Art is something we do, a verb. Art is an expression of our thoughts, emotions, intuitions, and desires, but it is even more personal than that: it’s about sharing the way we experience the world, which for many is an extension of personality.

<h3>What is Music?</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
  <p >Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Music is the process of putting sounds and tones in an order, often combining them to create a unified composition. People who make music creatively organize sounds for a desired result, like a Beethoven symphony or one of Duke Ellington's jazz songs.</p>
    <div class="image text-center padding"><img src="img/Music.jpg" alt="Image of icon representing music" class="Music" width="150"></div>
  <br>
  <p>Music is made of sounds, vibrations, and silent moments, and it doesn't always have to be pleasant or pretty. It can be used to convey a whole range of experiences, environments, and emotions. Different generes of Music includes:</p>

    <div class="h1 text-center padding">Sculpture</div>
    <h3> What is Sculpture?</h3>
    <div class="image text-center padding"><img src="img/Sculpture.jpg" alt="Image depicting a Sculputure" class="Sculputure" width="150"></div>
    <br>
    <p>sculpture, an artistic form in which hard or plastic materials are worked into three-dimensional art objects. The designs may be   embodied in freestanding objects, in reliefs on surfaces, or in environments ranging from tableaux to contexts that envelop the spectator.

      <div class="image text-center padding"><img src="img/Sculpture1.jpg" alt="Image depicting a Sculputure" class="Sculputure1" width="150"></div>

      <br><br>An enormous variety of media may be used, including clay, wax, stone, metal, fabric, glass, wood, plaster, rubber, and random “found” objects. Materials may be carved, modeled, molded, cast, wrought, welded, sewn, assembled, or otherwise shaped and combined. The seven elements of Sculputue includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <dt> Line </dt>
      <dd> Line is defined as a point moving in space where its length is greater than its width.</dd>
      <dt> Color </dt>
      <dd> Color can be used symbolically or to produce a pattern or to show contrast in a piece.</dd>
      <dt> Value </dt>
      <dd> Value is the lightness or darkness in color. </dd>
      <dt> Shape </dt>
      <dd> Shape is the result of closed lines, they are two dimensional and flat. Shapes can be geometric, such as squares or triangles or they can be organic and not have defined parameters and are more curved and abstract. Shapes in art can be used to control how the viewer perceives a piece. </dd>
      <dt> Form </dt>
      <dd> When shape acquires depth and becomes three dimensional, it takes on form. </dd>
      <dt> Space </dt>
      <dd> Space is any area an artist creates for a specific purpose. Space can be positive or negative. Positive space is an area occupied by an object or form. Negative space is the area that runs between, through, and around or within objects. This includes background, foreground, and middle ground. Space that can be manipulated in art based on how an artist uses lines, shape, form, and color. </dd>
      <dt> Texture </dt>
      <dd> Texture is how an object looks or feels. Sometimes texture can actually felt, such as in sculpture or the texture of work can be implied such as if you were to sketch a sheep’s wool. Some words to describe texture include soft, hard, rough, brittle, fluffy, or smooth. </dd>
    </ul>

      <div class="h1 text-center padding">Drawing</div>
      <h3>What is Drawing?</h3>
      <div class="image text-center padding"><img src="img/Drawing.jpg" alt="Picture of the black and white drawing of a cat" class="Drawing" width="150"></div>
    <br><p>Drawing, the art or technique of producing images on a surface, usually paper, by means of marks, usually of ink, graphite, chalk, charcoal, or crayon. 

      <div class="image text-center padding"><img src="img/Drawing1.jpg" alt="Picture of the coloured drawings of three eyes" class="Drawing1" width="150"></div>

      <br>

      Drawing as formal artistic creation might be defined as the primarily linear rendition of objects in the visible world, as well as of concepts, thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and fantasies given visual form, of symbols and even of abstract forms. The six main techniques in drawing for accuracy are: </p>

      <ul>
        <dl>
        <dt> Sighting / Measuring </dt>
        <dd> We can use “tools” to measure proportions of our subject in order to improve the accuracy of what we record in our drawings. We can use any tool that we wish, but a pencil works surprisingly well. </dd>
        <dt> The Grid Technique </dt>
        <dd> The grid technique is an approach to drawing that breaks the subject down into “bite-sized” pieces of visual information. </dd>
        <dt> Triangular Grid Technique </dt>
        <dd> An alternative to using the traditional grid technique is the triangular grid technique. This technique uses far less lines but requires a bit more from the artist. </dd>
        <dt> Linear Perspective </dt>
        <dd> Linear perspective is a system that uses lines to aid the artist in creating the illusion of space in a drawing. </dd>
        <dt> Basic Facial Proportions </dt>
        <dd> Although every face is different, certain approximate facial proportions do exist. We can use these approximations to ensure that the features of the face are placed in the right locations and that the size of each of the features are natural. </dd>
        <dt> Figure Proportions and Gesture Drawing </dt>
        <dd> Just as knowledge of basic facial proportions can be used to ensure accuracy in portrait drawing, knowledge of approximate figure proportions can aid in creating accurate figure drawings </dd>
      </dl>
      </ul>
